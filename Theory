Anstractization
After you create a Car class, you realize you have more types of cars, you can abstract it keeping the most general fields/methods in the abstract class 


Encapsulation
The process of making methods/fields private if not derectly used. (see getters and setters for private members)
Some methods are just helpers so they can be encapsulated.
